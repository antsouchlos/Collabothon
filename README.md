## Introduction

**#SustainableTomorrow** isn't just a hashtag; it's our vision for the future. CarbonGecko is not only a digital wellness app but also a carbon footprint accountability system that encourages and rewards responsible social media usage.

### The Challenge

In today's hyper-connected world, excessive social media engagement contributes to increased energy consumptionâ€”translating into a larger carbon footprint. Moreover, it's been detrimental to mental health globally. To tackle these issues, we've introduced a solution that incentivizes reduced social media usage, promoting a healthier, more environmentally friendly digital lifestyle.

### Our Solution

CarbonGecko is an innovative application that intertwines personal carbon credits with digital well-being. It's simple: earn rewards by minimizing your social media usage, thereby reducing your carbon footprint and improving mental health. It's time to embrace reality and make sustainable choices the Gecko way!
